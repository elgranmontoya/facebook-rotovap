I could’ve never imagined in high school that I would join debate in college. I considered myself very reserved, and I was always afraid of making and defending the wrong decisions. I remember my first debate meeting; I was so intimidated and scared by the length of the speeches, and the id...ea of argument generation and organization. (Could I really do this? Was I getting in over my head?)  What made me realize I wanted to stick around after that first tournament was both the amazing BADASS community, and the unique opportunity that debate presented for me to see and explore the east coast, and meet so many new people with such diverse experiences.  This school year hasn’t been easy. There are many times that I have felt insignificant and invisible, issues that I still struggle with, but debate has been a way to confront my insecurities and push past them. I saw as I continued on the league that I was able to continually improve at this activity and find competitive success, which made me so excited. I learned so much through Women's Initiative and I love the opportunity to build friendships with those from different schools.   In particular, I would like to thank the BADASS seniors (especially Sarah Margulies, David Altman  and Tom Whittaker, though I love all of you) for always listening to my experiences and giving me advice both within and outside of a debate context. I'm always so honored by your attention and wisdom (and great stories), and I’ll miss you guys so much.  To Amelia Berg and Danny Jaffe my two ProAms partners, you guys were arguably the two varsity that taught me the most about debate and I am so grateful for the amazing experiences we had at Northeastern and Yale together, and always somehow talking about debate while studying in the library.   Also, a shout out to the BADASS novice class who has been so friendly and fantastic. I’m glad I had the opportunity to debate with so many of you guys and I was so excited for the opportunity to break with Kevin Healey and Marc Siegel, two great friends that I thoroughly enjoyed debating with (and being sassy with in general). I can't wait to continue on this journey with all of you <333   This experience has always been rewarding to me through all of the van rides, team dinners, and familiar faces that I saw each weekend. And to all the people who have been part of such a great experience in some facet, though unfortunately I can't mention everyone in such a post, thank you!

Even till now, this is the day I am always looking forward ...to, to seeing your smile and touching your warmth once again, satisfied even if it is just in my dreams. However, thank to the trick well-known as fate, can I never stand beside you, trying to protect you like what you had always been doing for me. None will remember this exact date as none has forecasted all such nightmare. Finally as the countable time tickles down till the day that I am finally able to let it go, I would love to say: my beloved auntie happy birthday.  To those who are still fighting, turning against with the ones who unconditionally love you ever since you were born, I would like to remind you how luck you are while they are still around waiting for you to realize how grateful you are and love them back some day.

He is overcome by remorse, and cannot come to terms with a crime he committed decades ago. After days without food, he rises, dehydrated and exhausted, and asks to speak to a chaplain.  Within a few days, he appears in front of a slew of TV (hologram?) cameras and tearfully confesses to ...the crime, and apologizes to all those who endured the agony of that day. He regains his composure, takes a deep breath, and looks into the camera. He asks, begs, pleads with anyone watching never to do what he did. He tells them that human life should never be treated in such a way, that such violence can never be justified, and that there is no heroism in terrorism.  And somewhere out there, a very angry young boy watches this confession and hears the pleadings of his hero, and somewhere deep down in his heart, something changes.

I can't believe I was at your funeral today, it's surreal, and unbelievable in every terrible way. I keep trying to tell myself it's a cruel joke, that it could never have happened, but it did...and all I can possibly say is I'm sorry. I'm sorry we didn't keep in touch throughout the year. I'm sorry I didn't show you how mu...ch I value you as a friend. I'm sorry that you felt alone and I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you. I'm especially sorry that it took me until 2 days ago to realize that we weren't even friends on Facebook, and that you were out of sight, out of mind. If only I knew. If only I could have said something. If only.   You were always there for me at camp when I didn't fit in, when I knew no one else. It was you that helped introduce me to camp, and it was you that helped me feel comfortable. Whether it was N64 or the frisbee game that I can't remember the name of for the life of me, or just hanging out, you were always engaged and wanted to include everyone. It meant the world to me. We are both weird and quirky and different, and you helped me realize that was okay, I only wish I could have done the same for you.   Your entire family opened up their home to me on July 4th, and I've never seen you so happy as you were with  Josh , and Jared and Mikey, jamming out, chilling in the cabana, and enjoying the pool.   I will be eternally grateful to you for teaching me that it is always okay to be me, I only wish I could have done more for you. Danny you will always be in my heart.  May we all learn from Danny, may we all learn to be kind, to be genuine, to accept the fact that we are weird and embrace it. We aren't weird, we are unique, and we have so much to offer one another. We just need to reach out and start a conversation. Danny did that more than anyone, regardless of how hard it was for him.   May you finally find peace Danny, and may you be eternally happy.

After the murder of her husband in Poland and the forced removal of her son t...o another work camp, Stanislawa and her daughter entered Auschwitz with only one hope: that they would survive.  Soon after she arrived, however, Stanislawa began to realize that her particular set of skills as a midwife might be her saving grace. The women’s barracks at Auschwitz weren’t set up even for basic medical care — let alone caring for pregnant women and their babies. Stanislawa was pragmatic and resourceful, assuring that the beds closest to the barrack’s stove, which were apt to be the warmest, were reserved for the “maternity ward.”  Many women were brought into Auschwitz pregnant, some perhaps hadn’t even realized it, and for Stanislawa assuring the health of the mother and her baby often meant making sacrifices. She also was forced to instruct the women to make sacrifices of their own: a few weeks before the woman would deliver, the midwife would tell them to forgo their bread ration in order to barter for sheets, which would be used for diapers and swaddling for the baby. If sheets weren’t obtained in time, the babies were often wrapped in dirty paper.  Despite the horrors surrounding her, Stanislawa’s only concern when a woman went into labor was making her feel safe and comfortable — just as she had in Poland aiding laboring women in their homes. Women who were in the barracks with Stanislawa remembered her staying up through the night with woman after woman — hardly ever resting. She was a calm, composed and steady presence for all women there, and pretty soon everyone was calling her Mother.  In addition to her exhaustion and malnourishment, the barracks at Auschwitz had nothing by way of antiseptics, dressings or tools. This meant that Stanislawa had nothing to give women for the pain of childbirth, and all her practices were carefully monitored by Nazi physicians. There were many other Auschwitz medical professionals besides Stanislawa, and they cared for the sick and injured under Nazi guidance. These doctors were instructed to give progress updates on patients, and when a person was not apt to recover, they were immediately taken to the gas chamber.  Many who were in Auschwitz contracted Typhus, and though there was a fairly good chance they wouldn’t recover, the doctors often lied to the Nazis in order to buy them enough time to heal. If they succumbed to Typhus, at least they hadn’t been sent to the incinerator. Likewise, Stanislawa was immediately told to drown all the surviving infants she delivered.  The Nazis assumed that the babies would never survive to term–let alone labor and delivery, but when they acquired Stanislawa’s progress reports they realized that she had not lost a single baby — or mother — since she had begun practicing midwifery in the camp. They were immediately incredulous, and instructed her to drown the newborns in a barrel in the barracks. She refused, and risked her life by doing so. Instead, the task was given to an imprisoned German midwife who had been convicted of infanticide.  As Stanislawa continued to successfully bring thousands of babies into the world despite the camp’s treacherous conditions, the Nazis began to take any children born with Aryan features, sending them to orphanages to be adopted by German families. The mothers were devastated, and together with Stanislawa they found a way to surreptitiously tattoo the tiny babies in a subtle manner, with the hope that one day mother and child would be reunited.  Though she was able to help over 3,000 babies enter the world while imprisoned at Auschwitz, Stanislawa rarely spoke publicly of her time there. One story that she did regale to her children — who have subsequently told it on her behalf— involved a young mother whom she had assisted during labor. Within a few hours, the young mother’s number was called to go to the chamber. The woman bundled her up and wrapped the baby in damp paper fluttering around the barracks. Knowing that she was about to die, the woman clutched her newborn to breast and walked out of the barracks.  Obviously, the women at the camp understood Stanislawa’s incredible presence–as did those responsible for placing her there in the first place. Dr. Menegle visited the “maternity ward” in the women’s barracks and was furious that the midwife was allowing the babies to survive. She orchestrated wet-nurses within the barracks who would suckle the babies whose mothers were so malnourished their milk never came in, and thus, babies who were born close to the camp’s liberation survived.  Even though Menegle was clearly opposed to Stanislawa’s saving of Jewish infants and their mothers, he did remark to the other Nazi physicians that not only was she an exceptionally skilled midwife, but that she was the personification of hope prisoners clung to that they may, eventually, escape the camp.  Released when the camp was liberated, Stanislawa was reunited with her children, both of whom went on to become doctors. Until her retirement in the 1950s, Stanislawa never really spoke of her time in Auschwitz. What she did share, and what others who had been in the camp with her shared, went on to be documented as justification for her beatification by the Catholic Church as a saint, a process that began in 2010.  Stanislawa died in 1974, but her story is perhaps the most miraculous account from the Holocaust’s history. As she spoke about her time at Auschwitz upon her retirement, she concluded her story by saying that even though many of the 3,000 babies born in the camp perished at the hands of the Nazis, either directly through murder or indirectly through malnourishment, she was proud to say that every single one of them had been born alive and into her waiting, loving hands.

Many who were in Auschwitz contracted Typhus, and though there was a fairly good chance they wouldn’t recover, the doctors often lied to the Nazis in order to buy them enough time to heal. If they succumbed to Typhus, at least they hadn’t been sent to the incinerator. Likewise, Stanislawa was immediately told to drown all the surviving infants she delivered.  The Nazis assumed that the babies would never survive to term–let alone labor and delivery, but when they acquired Stanislawa’s progress reports they realized that she had not lost a single baby — or mother — since she had begun practicing midwifery in the camp. They were immediately incredulous, and instructed her to drown the newborns in a barrel in the barracks. She refused, and risked her life by doing so. Instead, the task was given to an imprisoned German midwife who had been convicted of infanticide.  As Stanislawa continued to successfully bring thousands of babies into the world despite the camp’s treacherous conditions, the Nazis began to take any children born with Aryan features, sending them to orphanages to be adopted by German families. The mothers were devastated, and together with Stanislawa they found a way to surreptitiously tattoo the tiny babies in a subtle manner, with the hope that one day mother and child would be reunited.  Though she was able to help over 3,000 babies enter the world while imprisoned at Auschwitz, Stanislawa rarely spoke publicly of her time there. One story that she did regale to her children — who have subsequently told it on her behalf— involved a young mother whom she had assisted during labor. Within a few hours, the young mother’s number was called to go to the chamber. The woman bundled her up and wrapped the baby in damp paper fluttering around the barracks. Knowing that she was about to die, the woman clutched her newborn to breast and walked out of the barracks.  Obviously, the women at the camp understood Stanislawa’s incredible presence–as did those responsible for placing her there in the first place. Dr. Menegle visited the “maternity ward” in the women’s barracks and was furious that the midwife was allowing the babies to survive. She orchestrated wet-nurses within the barracks who would suckle the babies whose mothers were so malnourished their milk never came in, and thus, babies who were born close to the camp’s liberation survived.  Even though Menegle was clearly opposed to Stanislawa’s saving of Jewish infants and their mothers, he did remark to the other Nazi physicians that not only was she an exceptionally skilled midwife, but that she was the personification of hope prisoners clung to that they may, eventually, escape the camp.  Released when the camp was liberated, Stanislawa was reunited with her children, both of whom went on to become doctors. Until her retirement in the 1950s, Stanislawa never really spoke of her time in Auschwitz. What she did share, and what others who had been in the camp with her shared, went on to be documented as justification for her beatification by the Catholic Church as a saint, a process that began in 2010.  Stanislawa died in 1974, but her story is perhaps the most miraculous account from the Holocaust’s history. As she spoke about her time at Auschwitz upon her retirement, she concluded her story by saying that even though many of the 3,000 babies born in the camp perished at the hands of the Nazis, either directly through murder or indirectly through malnourishment, she was proud to say that every single one of them had been born alive and into her waiting, loving hands.

After the murder of her husband in Poland and the forced removal of her son t...o another work camp, Stanislawa and her daughter entered Auschwitz with only one hope: that they would survive.  Soon after she arrived, however, Stanislawa began to realize that her particular set of skills as a midwife might be her saving grace. The women’s barracks at Auschwitz weren’t set up even for basic medical care — let alone caring for pregnant women and their babies. Stanislawa was pragmatic and resourceful, assuring that the beds closest to the barrack’s stove, which were apt to be the warmest, were reserved for the “maternity ward.”  Many women were brought into Auschwitz pregnant, some perhaps hadn’t even realized it, and for Stanislawa assuring the health of the mother and her baby often meant making sacrifices. She also was forced to instruct the women to make sacrifices of their own: a few weeks before the woman would deliver, the midwife would tell them to forgo their bread ration in order to barter for sheets, which would be used for diapers and swaddling for the baby. If sheets weren’t obtained in time, the babies were often wrapped in dirty paper.  Despite the horrors surrounding her, Stanislawa’s only concern when a woman went into labor was making her feel safe and comfortable — just as she had in Poland aiding laboring women in their homes. Women who were in the barracks with Stanislawa remembered her staying up through the night with woman after woman — hardly ever resting. She was a calm, composed and steady presence for all women there, and pretty soon everyone was calling her Mother.  In addition to her exhaustion and malnourishment, the barracks at Auschwitz had nothing by way of antiseptics, dressings or tools. This meant that Stanislawa had nothing to give women for the pain of childbirth, and all her practices were carefully monitored by Nazi physicians. There were many other Auschwitz medical professionals besides Stanislawa, and they cared for the sick and injured under Nazi guidance. These doctors were instructed to give progress updates on patients, and when a person was not apt to recover, they were immediately taken to the gas chamber.  Many who were in Auschwitz contracted Typhus, and though there was a fairly good chance they wouldn’t recover, the doctors often lied to the Nazis in order to buy them enough time to heal. If they succumbed to Typhus, at least they hadn’t been sent to the incinerator. Likewise, Stanislawa was immediately told to drown all the surviving infants she delivered.  The Nazis assumed that the babies would never survive to term–let alone labor and delivery, but when they acquired Stanislawa’s progress reports they realized that she had not lost a single baby — or mother — since she had begun practicing midwifery in the camp. They were immediately incredulous, and instructed her to drown the newborns in a barrel in the barracks. She refused, and risked her life by doing so.
